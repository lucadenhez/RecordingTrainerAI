audio\1.wav|Well, this is the real thing.Except the island was the Andes mountains, and the “lost” were a group of boys who would face a dilemma too shocking, and too real, for prime time—whether to die a slow, excruciating death or eat the frozen bodies of their dead friends. 
audio\2.wav|This was the stark choice facing a rugby team from Uruguay, and some of their friends and family, when the plane carrying them to a match in Chile crashed on October 13, 1972, in what was fittingly known as The Valley of Tears.Their story would amaze—and disturb—the world and become the basis for a best-selling selling book and the movie, Alive. 
audio\3.wav|Roberto Canessa was a 19-year-old medical student when the plane went down.In the intervening years, he became one of Uruguay’s best-known pediatric cardiologists. 
audio\4.wav|But the lessons he learned on the mountain never left him.His new book, I Had To Survive: How a Plane Crash in The Andes Inspired My Calling to Save Lives, tells the story of a young man who survived impossible odds—and went on to devote his life to giving hope to others.

audio\5.wav|Talking from Philadelphia, during his book tour, he explains how the joy of living was the key to overcoming death, how he coped with the shocking dilemma he faced on the mountain, and why we should all be more grateful for what we have.You were 19 when the plane carrying you and your rugby team crashed high in the Andes. 
audio\6.wav|Put us inside that moment.It was a very abrupt moment. 
audio\7.wav|We had rented an air force plane to go from Uruguay to Chile.We were trying to cross the Andes when the pilot said, “Fasten your seatbelts, we are going to enter some turbulence.” Rugby players like to fool around and play macho. 
audio\8.wav|So we were throwing around rugby balls and singing a song, “Conga, conga, conga: the plane is dancing conga.” The next thing, someone looked out the window and said, “Aren’t we flying too close to the mountains?!”  The pilot had made a huge mistake: He’d turned north and begun the descent to Santiago while the aircraft was still in the high Andes.He began to climb, until the plane was nearly vertical and it began to stall and shake. 
audio\9.wav|Then we smashed into the side of the mountain.I was thrown forward with  tremendous force and received a powerful blow to my head. 
audio\10.wav|I thought, “You’re dead.” I grabbed my seat and recited a Hail Mary.Someone cried out, “Please God, help me, help me!” It was the worst nightmare you can imagine. 
audio\11.wav|Another boy was screaming, “I’m blind!”  When he moved his head I could see his brain—and a piece of metal sticking out of his stomach.There have been other books, and the movie Alive, about this event. 
audio\12.wav|What made you want to write another book?a still of Matthew Fox from the television show "Lost" TV series "Lost," starring Matthew Fox (above) offered a sanitized, primetime version of what might happen after a plane crashes on a remote desert island. 
audio\13.wav|I encouraged everyone to write his own book because they are 16 different stories of survival.Personally, I believe this was a kind of experiment by a malicious hand that decided to throw onto the mountain a group of young rugby players. 
audio\14.wav|University students with education and a belief in God—ideal guinea pigs for an experiment in human behavior.Who survived? 
audio\15.wav|It wasn’t the smartest, most intelligent ones.The ones who survived were those who most felt the joy of living. 
audio\16.wav|That gave them a reason to survive.Why do you think you survived?
